DEPRECATION WARNING on line 3, column 8 of /Users/overture/sites/11kbw/wp-content/themes/11kbw/src/scss/main.scss:
Including .css files with @import is non-standard behaviour which will be removed in future versions of LibSass.
Use a custom importer to maintain this behaviour. Check your implementations documentation on how to create a custom importer.

Solving:
Copy the main.css file and go the the scss folder and create a folder called  lib and create file inside called  _normalized.scss, 
then inside scss/main.scss file change the @import file path to @import 'lib/normalize';
Then do run $ gulp in terminal
